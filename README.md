The handler.ts file there was a code searching for types of pokemons and getting each type's URL and then calculating the average stats but when I read the docs on https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#types there isn't any field for "base_state" I don't know if I misunderstood the meaning of the attribute "base_stat" and "averageBaseExperience"

## Usage

```bash
# development: hot reload with nodemon
$ npm run dev

# debug
$ npm run debug

# format with prettier
$ npm run format

# build for production
